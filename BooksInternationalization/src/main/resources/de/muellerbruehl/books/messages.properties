textWelcome=Discover the books I've reviewed. Get references to the printed publication or links to online reviews.\n\nPlease choose from the categories or enter a term for searching. Or you might choose from the list of reviews published on this site.\n\nTo cover parts of the server fees, I participate the Amazon partner progam. If you follow a link from a cover image to buy something from Amazon you will help to finance this site. Of course, you may buy the books wherever you like.\n\nThis site is powered by JavaServer Faces technology. Read about the implementation in my book <a href="http://leanpub.com/jsf">"Web Development with Java and JSF"</a> and in my blog <a href="http://blog.mueller-bruehl.de/en/">[blog.mueller-bruehl.de]</a>.\n
